SSW-695

Project Description -
Our project, focuses on implementing computer vision techniques using DeepLabCut to track specific points on the human body during exercise sessions. The primary goal is to provide real-time biofeedback to users by visualizing the movement and positions of key points on their arms. This approach enhances the exercise experience by offering precise insights into form and posture.
